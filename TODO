-harden MP from hacking.
 -socket.emit('createSession') w/o correct object and the server shuts down

-powerups (cone shoot, powerful shots, faster engine, better inertial dampeners
-gameover
-points - steady increase w/ timer, maybe not points but cash - use cash to buy powerups?
-enemy mothership
-sound FX
-cool things encountered - when all stars move in one direction but with a nudge, the effect is sweet.  When explodingtext is called but the screen is not cleared, it's sweet.
- ctx.fillRect() and ctx.createRadialGradient do some cool stuff when creating many on top of eachtoerh in the same place.  Like a beacon.  
-add dev_options to readout - will have asteroids array, noExplodeAsteroids array, bullets, what else?


--- multiplayer ---
-game must be deterministic.  So every respawning of asteroids must be predetermined by server so it's the same on both clients
-should have 1p or 2p games.  1p is all client side.  maybe single player or multiplayer.
-app starts out with a SP or MP screen, with Asteroids as the title or something.
-would be awesome to not have separate JS for each.  Just a flag for single or multiplayer.
