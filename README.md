##Asteroids

This game is (obviously) a clone of the original Asteroids game from the 18th century.  Scholars maintain it was first played by monks, each frame being painstakingly drawn out by hand.  Others believe the game came from aliens who gave it to creatures from the paleolithic era.  Either way, it's old.  That's really the main point that I'm trying to drive home here.
