## Asteroids

http://asteroids.aaronik.com

This game is (obviously) a clone of the original Asteroids game from the 18th
century.  Scholars maintain it was first played by monks, each frame being
painstakingly drawn out by hand.  Others believe the game came from aliens who
gave it to creatures from the paleolithic era.  Either way, it's old.  That's
really the main point that I'm trying to drive home here.

This incarnation of the game exists as a purely client side game, there's no server
to be found, save for the @browser-network switchboard, which moonlights as a switchboard
for all my other client side only apps as well.

See https://github.com/browser-network for how the networking works.
